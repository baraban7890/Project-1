### Project Overview
Using data from the US Department of Health and Human Services, this project aims to evaluate the frequency of weekly reported symptoms of anxiety since 2020, across multiple demographic categories and subcategories.  

The main objectives of the project include the following:
1. Evaluate trends within specific sub-categories of the population to support or challenge the theory that the COVID-19 lockdown had varying impacts on mental health distress across different groups.
2. Identify and analyze other potential causes of anxiety, such as holidays and seasonal changes, if applicable.  Ultimately, identify any interpret specific findings or correlations within the time series data that may lead to insights for the user of the data.
3. Provide insights to client for use in evaluating key needs within the industry to plan resources to support the mental health needs of various demographic groups.

### Usage and Installation Instructions

### Examples of Application and/or Results - Summary of Analysis

Insights:


Brainstorm ideas:
- Seasonal Variations !!!
- Age groups 
- Gender 
- Time periods !!! during and after lockdown. !!!
- Race
- Create a column that denotes monthly averages based on (Start date?).

Notes from Instructor:
### Feature importance: How important is a feature in determining the outcome  
### Create month, day and year columns  
### Can use the end month/date as well, can separate into end month, day, year cols  
### Calculate "Distance" or days between end and start date and make that a column  

Potential Bias:
### Voluntary response
- May underrepresent or overrepresent the amount of people with depression or anxiety symptoms
### Internet questionnaire, invitations sent be email/text
- Households without internet, computers, phones, emails are underrepresented.
### Housing units!!!!!!
- Underrepresents homeless people.
### One respondent per housing unit
- Potential bias here


End Goal:  
Our end goal in this project is to predict whether or not a group may be at risk for depressive or anxiety symptoms.  
Provide insights to potential clients so they may either cut back or allocate more of their budget to mental health resources based on these predictions.
